Project for Python Class

This project will have a few features.
1. It will read the data from the calottery website on all its scratcher games 
(http://www.calottery.com/play/scratchers-games/top-prizes-remaining)
2. It will calculate expected value for all games to help predict your return based on some simple assumptions
3. It will compare your odds for that particular game versus the odds for all the games available and present the result in a chart
4. The calculations and results will run in a simple website running the underlying application.
